socket.io
=========

#### Sockets for the rest of us

The `socket.io` client is basically a simple HTTP Socket interface implementation. It allows you to establish a realtime connection with a server (see `socket.io` server [here](http://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node)), hiding the complexity of the different transports (WebSocket, Flash, forever iframe, XHR long polling, XHR multipart encoded, etc), while retaining a WebSocket-like API:

	socket = new io.Socket('localhost');
	socket.connect();
	socket.on('connect', function(){
		// connected
	});
	socket.on('message', function(data){
		// data here
	});
	socket.send('some data');

### Features

- Supports 
	- WebSocket
	- Adobe Flash Socket
	- ActiveX HTMLFile (IE)
	- XHR with multipart encoding
	- XHR with long-polling
	- JSONP polling (for cross-domain)

- Tested on
	- Safari 4
	- Google Chrome 5
	- Internet Explorer 6
	- Internet Explorer 7
	- Internet Explorer 8
	- iPhone Safari
	- iPad Safari
	- Firefox 3
	- Firefox 4 (Minefield)
	- Opera 10.61
	
- ActionScript Socket is known not to work behind proxies, as it doesn't have access to the user agent proxy settings to implement the CONNECT HTTP method. If it fails, `socket.io` will try something else.
	
- On a successful connection, it remembers the transport for next time (stores it in a cookie).

- Small. Closure Compiled with all deps: 5.82kb (gzipped).

- Easy to use! See [socket.io-node](http://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node) for the server to connect to.

### How to use
	
In your head
	
	<script src="/path/to/the/socket.io/client/socket.io.js">
	<script>
		io.setPath('/path/to/the/socket.io/client/');
	</script>
	
In your code

	socket = new io.Socket('localhost');
	socket.connect();
	socket.send('some data');
	socket.on('message', function(data){
		alert('got some data' + data);
	});
	
For an example, check out the chat [source](https://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node/blob/master/test/chat.html).

`io.setPath` is required in order for socket.io to find the Flash WebSocket files. The path should be the path where you checked out the Socket.IO client repository.

### Notes

If you are serving you .swf from a other domain than socket.io.js you will need to change the lib/vendor/web-socket-js/WebSocketMain.swf to the insecure version.
The insecure version can be found [here](http://github.com/gimite/web-socket-js/blob/master/WebSocketMainInsecure.zip).

IMPORTANT! When checking out the git repo, make sure to include the submodules. One way to do it is:

	git clone [repo] --recursive
  
Another, once cloned

	git submodule update --init --recursive

### Documentation 

#### io.Socket

	new io.Socket(host, [options]);

Options:

- *port*

		Current port or 80
	
	The port `socket.io` server is attached to (defaults to the document.location port)

- *resource*

		socket.io

  The resource is what allows the `socket.io` server to identify incoming connections by `socket.io` clients. In other words, any HTTP server can implement socket.io and still serve other normal, non-realtime HTTP requests.

- *transports*

		['websocket', 'flashsocket', 'htmlfile', 'xhr-multipart', 'xhr-polling']

	A list of the transports to attempt to utilize (in order of preference)
	
- *transportOptions*
	
		{
			someTransport: {
				someOption: true
			},
			...
		}
				
	An object containing (optional) options to pass to each transport.

Properties:

- *options*

	The passed in options combined with the defaults

- *connected*

	Whether the socket is connected or not.
	
- *connecting*

	Whether the socket is connecting or not.
	
- *transport*	

	The transport instance.

Methods:
	
- *connect*

	Establishes a connection	
	
- *send(message)*
	
	A string of data to send.
	
- *disconnect*

	Closes the connection
	
- *on(event, λ)*

	Adds a listener for the event *event*
	
- *removeEvent(event, λ)*

	Removes the listener λ for the event *event*
	
Events:

- *connect*

	Fired when the connection is established and the handshake successful
	
- *message(message)*
	
	Fired when a message arrives from the server

- *close*

	Fired when the connection is closed. Be careful with using this event, as some transports will fire it even under temporary, expected disconnections (such as XHR-Polling).
	
- *disconnect*

	Fired when the connection is considered disconnected.

### Changelog

2010 08 02 - **0.5.4** (9.95KB)

* Added io.util.load as a reusable onload handler
* Added io.util.ios which reports if the UA is running on iPhone or iPad
* No more loading bar on iPhone: XHR-Polling now connects `onload` for the iOS WebKit, and waits 10 ms to launch the initial connection.
